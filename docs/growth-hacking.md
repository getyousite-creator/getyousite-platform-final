# SOVEREIGN GROWTH HACKING: MOROCCAN MARKET VOID
## Protocol: Acquisition of first 100 users with Zero Ad Spend.

### 1. The "Zero Commission" Wedge
**Logic:** Moroccan sellers are tired of YouCan/Salla commissions. 
- **Action:** Post comparison tables in Moroccan E-commerce Facebook/Telegram groups.
- **Hook:** "Stop paying for your own sales. Pay for infrastructure, keep your profits. Sovereign logic."

### 2. High-Ticket White-Gloving
**Logic:** High-end Moroccan brands (Artisans, Real Estate) want custom prestige, not generic templates.
- **Action:** Directly DM 20 premium Instagram brands in Marrakech/Casa. Offer them a 'Blueprint Deployment' of LuxeCart or AlphaStorePro. 
- **Hook:** "Your brand is premium, your site shouldn't look like a 2010 template. Here is a sub-100ms architecture built for you."

### 3. The "Resu" Trust Hack
**Logic:** WhatsApp is the REAL internet in Morocco.
- **Action:** Share the 'Manual Payment' flow receipt screenshots in groups. 
- **Hook:** "No card? No problem. Transfer via CIH, upload the reçu, and launch. Cash is king."

### 4. LinkedIn Professional Audit
**Logic:** Digital Agencies in Morocco are inefficient. 
- **Action:** Targeted posts on the 'Technical Sovereignty' of the platform.
- **Hook:** "Why wait weeks for a site when you can deploy a site-blueprint in minutes? Next.js + Supabase + Moroccan Hybrid Payments."
